# Dark Mode ðŸŒ™

Hello, in this project I decided to create a script so that you can have the dark mode in your web project easily. I basically add a pop-up and when activated it injects a css, which you can modify in the variable "darkStyle". I used the cache to maintain dark mode during the navegation.

Have a good one ! ðŸ‘‹
